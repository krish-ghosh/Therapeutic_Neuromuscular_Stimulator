# Therapeutic_Neuromuscular_Stimulator
A DIY electronic muscle stimulator circuit that stimulates nerves of that part of your body where electrodes are attached. It is useful to relieve headache and muscular pain and revive frozen muscles that impair movement. Though it provides muscle stimulation and invigoration, itâ€™s mainly an aid in removing cellulitis.
